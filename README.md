## Key Features

### Featured Section
Our platform features a prominent "Featured Section" on the homepage, showcasing top engaging influencers and YouTubers. This section regularly rotates to highlight different influencers, offering them increased exposure and recognition.

### Admin Panel
We've developed an intuitive and secure admin panel that allows administrators to manage and control the platform effectively. The admin panel includes functionalities to moderate content, manage user accounts, and monitor platform activities to ensure a safe and enjoyable user experience.

### Latest Onboarded Influencers/YouTubers
Stay updated with the latest talent! A dedicated section on the platform displays the most recently onboarded influencers and YouTubers, keeping our platform fresh and allowing new talents to gain visibility.

### Influencer Showcase Panel
Discover the profiles and information about all the influencers and YouTubers on our platform through a comprehensive showcase panel. Users can easily search, browse, and filter the list of influencers, making it simple to find the perfect collaborator.

### Pricing and Work Showcase
Each influencer's profile includes a section where they can showcase their pricing details and previous work. This feature is designed to help potential clients view an influencer's portfolio and understand their services, facilitating informed collaboration decisions.

### Paid Promotion Form
To streamline collaboration requests, we have implemented a form that influencers can fill out if they are open to paid promotions. This information is securely stored in the backend for review and consideration by potential clients, making the collaboration process more efficient.

### Niche Filter
Users can filter and view influencers based on their specific niches or areas of expertise. This powerful feature makes it easier for brands to identify influencers who align with their products or services, ensuring that collaborations are relevant and effective.
